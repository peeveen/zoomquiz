# zoomquiz

Windows app for presenting online quizzes via Zoom.

* Absolutely _thrown_ together at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown. Code is pretty messy.
* Integrates with Zoom and OBS.
* Too many prerequisites to mention.
* Needs a real Heath-Robinson audio routing setup via VoiceMeeter.
* Supports quizzes with text, image, audio and video questions written in a bespoke INI-like file format.
* Basically, here be dragons.
